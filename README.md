# Portfolio Projects by Abang Amirulluqman Farhan aka Flame Cerberus

This is a portfolio for a compilation of my projects created for personal use and also professional use during my college years which consist of electronic and AI-related projects.

## Stand-alone projects

### Smart Decision Assistant: Let AI Guide Your Career Choice

A website uses GeminiAI's API to analyze resumes and compare them to job descriptions. It also scrapes job titles from LinkedIn and Indeed, generating a table showing the match percentage between each job description and the parsed resume. It's a tool to help job seekers make informed decisions in their job search.

### IoT-based Location Tracking and Health Monitoring Device

The project aims to provide a comprehensive health and location-tracking solution for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Utilizing an ESP32 NodeMCU microcontroller and various sensors, the system monitors health parameters such as heart rate, SpO2, body temperature, and location using GPS. The collected data is then uploaded to ThingSpeak through a GSM module for remote monitoring.
